      <description>Architecture Summary Application grid is a feature to support such a scenario described as following:
 Application is deployed in many grids, each grid has a number of nodes The pods in each grid can communiate with the others in the same grid by service, other pods which aren&amp;rsquo;t in the same grid can&amp;rsquo;t be in touch with this grid by service. This can be called service isolation. Application keeps some replicas in each grid.</description>
