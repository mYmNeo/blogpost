      <description>Architecture Summary Application grid is a feature to support such a scenario described as following:
 Application is deployed in many grids, each grid has a number of nodes The pods in each grid can communiate with the others in the same grid by service, other pods which aren&amp;rsquo;t in the same grid can&amp;rsquo;t be in touch with this grid by service. This can be called service isolation. Application keeps some replicas in each grid.</description>

      <description>Architecture Summary To support topology in old version kubernetes, we need to add a middleware programm between kube-proxy and kube-apiserver. By this method, we can hijack and modify the data which is sent to kube-proxy. Then we can controll the network rules without change kube-proxy code. We call our programm kube-proxy-wrapper.
Implementation To keep consistence as much as possible with the latest version of Kubernetes. We also use kubernetes.io/hostname, topology.kubernetes.io/zone and topology.</description>
